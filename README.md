AIcademy - AI-Powered E-Learning Platform

<!-- Project Overview -->

AIcademy is an innovative e-learning platform designed to provide a personalized and engaging learning experience. It leverages AI to offer course recommendations and potentially adjust content difficulty, while also empowering instructors with comprehensive tools to manage their courses and track student progress. The platform supports multiple user roles: Students, Instructors, and Professionals.

<!-- Features -->

<!-- Core Features -->

User Authentication & Authorization: Secure registration, login, and role-based access for Students, Instructors, and Professionals.

Onboarding Process: Guided initial setup for new users, including role selection and a survey for personalized recommendations.

Course Catalog: Browse and search a wide range of courses with filters for categories, difficulty, and more.

Course Details: Comprehensive pages for each course, including descriptions, modules, lessons, and enrollment functionality.

Course Enrollment: Seamless enrollment process for students.

<!-- Prerequisites -->

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Version 18.x or higher (includes npm)

Download Node.js

Python: Version 3.9 or higher

Download Python

pip: Python package installer (usually comes with Python)

git: For cloning the repository

Download Git

<!-- Getting Started -->

Follow these steps to set up and run the AIcademy project locally.

<!-- 1. Clone the Repository -->

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone <your-repository-url> Project
cd Project

<!-- 2. Backend Setup -->

Navigate to the Django backend project directory:

cd backend

<!-- a. Create and Activate Virtual Environment -->

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

<!-- b. Install Backend Dependencies -->

Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt located in backend/elearning_project/:

pip install -r requirements.txt

<!-- c. Configure Django Settings -->

Important: Ensure your backend/elearning_project/elearning_project/settings.py file has all necessary Django apps listed in INSTALLED_APPS. Based on your structure, this should include:

# backend/elearning_project/elearning_project/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... default django apps
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework_simplejwt',
    'authentication',
    'courses',
    'enrollments',
    'progress',
    'ai_core',
    # For apps nested under 'apps/' directory:
    'apps.users',
    'apps.progress_tracking',
    'apps.chat_bot',
    # Note: 'apps.ai_recommendations' exists in your structure, but 'ai_core' is used for AI views.
    # If 'apps.ai_recommendations' is intended to be used, ensure its functionality is integrated.
    # Otherwise, it might be redundant or for future expansion.
]

Also, ensure backend/elearning_project/apps/__init__.py exists and is empty, allowing Django to discover the nested apps.

<!-- d. Database Setup -->

Apply database migrations to create the necessary tables:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

<!-- e. Create a Superuser (Admin Account) -->

You'll need an admin account to access the Django admin panel and manage data:

python manage.py createsuperuser

Follow the prompts to set up your username, email, and password.

<!-- f. Run the Backend Server -->

Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

The backend API will be running on http://localhost:8000/. Keep this terminal open.

<!-- 3. Frontend Setup -->

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project root directory where package.json is located:

# If you are still in backend/elearning_project:
cd ../../ 

# Otherwise, navigate directly to C:\Users\debap\Desktop\SDP NEWW\project\
# cd C:\Users\debap\Desktop\SDP NEWW\project\

<!-- a. Install Frontend Dependencies -->

Install the Node.js packages:

npm install

<!-- b. Run the Frontend Development Server -->

Start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev

The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000/. Keep this terminal open.

Accessing the Application
Once both frontend and backend servers are running:

Main Application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Django Admin: Access the backend administration panel at http://localhost:8000/admin/ using your superuser credentials.
